### This is the development brach of https://ized.online

Current Features:
- In-browser WebGL rendering
- Z-index implementation
- mix-blend-mode CSS implementation with two non-background elements (one being a script!)

Current objectives:
- Steamlined audio playback (hosted, not a soundcloud embed etc)
- Mobile compatability
- Compatability with devices that arent powerful enough to render WebGL.
  - Light mode?
- Actual site layout beyond playing a few of my songs
  - Maybe I should work out what my purpose of the site is before I try and make it gud :///
