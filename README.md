### This is the development site for aspects of https://ized.online

Current Features:
- In-browser WebGL rendering
	- Reactive WebGL (Three.js) implementation (moves with audio, pauses when audio is paused)
		- Chrome + Firefox Compatability
- Z-index implementation
- mix-blend-mode CSS implementation with two non-background elements (one being a script!)
- Partial audio support (play/pause of one track)
- Basic scaling gives useable experience on most devices


Current objectives:
- Steamlined audio playback (more verbose, better controls etc)
- Compatability with devices that arent powerful enough to render WebGL.
  - Light/no JS mode?
- Actual site layout
  - Contact form
  - Links to socials
  - blog for code examples
  - art
  - ml5.js for something
