### This is the development branch of https://ized.online

Current Features:
- In-browser WebGL rendering
- Z-index implementation
- mix-blend-mode CSS implementation with two non-background elements (one being a script!)
- Partial audio support (play/pause of one track, getting a text element to change from play to pause)
- Basic scaling to support most devices

Current objectives:
- Steamlined audio playback (hosted, not a soundcloud embed etc)
- Compatability with devices that arent powerful enough to render WebGL.
  - Light/no JS mode?
- Actual site layout beyond playing a few of my songs
  - Maybe I should work out what my purpose of the site is before I try and make it gud :///
  - Contact form
  - Links to socials
- Change speed of rotation based on track BPM
- Pause rotation of brain when song is paused
- Reactive WebGL based on audio
- JavaScript (ewwwww)
